				A freestyle train station. It introduces some new special tracks, which will serve as platforms for cargo or passengers.

                [h1]Instructions[/h1]
				Lay platforms alongside normal tracks, then place a platform marker and a track marker where you want the platform and the track to end. Repeat at the other end.
				WAIT A MOMENT and let the computer think.
                Now you have built a terminal, trains will stop between your track markers.
                Add more platforms, tracks and markers, a popup will ask you if you want to join your new terminal to the other ones. You can have up to 12 terminals in one station.

                Now click your station to open the configuration menu and add some connections.
                - Adjacent platforms are connected together automatically. If you added extra platforms or space between, you will have to connect them by hand instead: use a suitable street type and <shift>. Avoid this with tunnels and bridges, keep it simple.
                - Every set of adjacent ground platforms requires street access, an underpass, a lift or stairs.
                - Every set of adjacent bridge platforms requires a lift or an underpass.
                - Every bridge level requires a lift, or an underpass near a ground platform lift or stairs.
                - Every set of adjacent underground platforms requires stairs.
                - Every underground level requires an underground entrance, or a ground platform with an underpass, or a higher underground level with stairs down (if you have multiple underground levels, you can add stairs on the higher levels, to go down to the lower levels).

                You can share a platform between two terminals, for example the first 100 metres with terminal 1 and the rest with terminal 2. If you do that, connect the platform ends by hand with a suitable street type and <shift>.
                You cannot share one stretch of platform among multiple terminals.

				When you bulldoze a terminal, the mod will try to rebuild the tracks as they were before, to make changes easy: bulldoze a terminal, change what you need, then rebuild it with the markers.
				When you bulldoze the station, everything will be bulldozed.

				Lifts, stairs and underground entrances are in the assets, search for "freestyle station".
				
				[h1]Tips:[/h1]
                - Platforms are tracks and they can also suffer from micro splits, very difficult to see.
				- To visualise the lanes and the splits, start the game in debug mode and press <AltGr> + <L>. This is particularly useful with multi-level underground stations.
				- To work underground, use <NumPad 4> or the 'Look Underground' track construction.
				- Platforms only carry passengers or cargo if they are part of a terminal.
				- 2.5 m platforms do not agree with bridges and tunnels. My 'no railing' bridges help, tunnels can't be helped.
                - This mod adds extra bridges to help with elevated stations.
                - Very thin paths help with certain setups: those are in my street fine tuning mod.
				- This mod adds extra pedestrian paths and bridges. Some of those paths turn into bridges after placing them. They can be tricky to place, the street fine tuning 'chunks' and 'splitter' constructions come to the rescue.
				- Sound effects for stations are in my dedicated mod.
				- Sound effects for trains are in my dedicated mod.
				- Extra ground textures are in my terrain tweaks mod.
				- If you want different buildings, use assets. There are mods with those.
				- This mod adds stairs and lifts as configurable assets; they can be used anywhere. My 'Construction Mover' mod helps to place them easily. Still, the game does not handle them gracefully and AltGr + L will help you snap them to your network.
				- Use the track constructions "Smart track splitter" to do precision work.
				- Upgrading tracks does all tracks at once.
				- If you have too many track types, use the categories in the menu to make life easier.

				[h1]Note:[/h1]
				Underground stations are now in the assets.

				[h1]Known issues:[/h1]
				- Module placement is rather free, the player is allowed to do some unrealistic things. Proper checks would be too expensive.
				- Station naming does not work properly.
				- 2.5 m platforms do not agree with bridges and tunnels. Ask UG to make trackDistance work.
				- The bigger your station is, the longer it takes to add or remove a terminal. It can take over a minute. Just wait.
				- Some modules can only be placed after some others, eg stairs exits after stairs, but the menu does not refresh automatically. After placing the first set of stairs, you need to close and reopen the menu for stairs exits to appear.
				- Some track and signal mods are incompatible. As a general rule, avoid mods that overwrite stock game tracks or make them unavailable. Chances are they are bad anyway.
				- Minor version 1.81 (31st August 2022) introduced important layout changes. Previously built terminals will keep working but might have some glitches. To benefit from the changes, remove them, wait for them to reappear and build them anew.
